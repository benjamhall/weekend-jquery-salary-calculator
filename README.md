## Description

What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The goal of this assignment was to build a functional salary calculator. I solved this by setting up html, css, client.js files and getting jquery and bootstrap libraries. 

Next, I created an html file with input form with employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary. As well as a table for the same entries and a monthly total cost following the table

After, this I created a readyNow function in the client.js file to ensure that jQuery is loaded. Then create add 

Usage

If someone wants to calculate the total monthly costs based upon the annual salaries of their employees, they can enter the employee information and submit it and it will calculate the total monthly cost. If the cost exceeds 20k, they will be notified by the total monthly cost turning red. 

Built With
